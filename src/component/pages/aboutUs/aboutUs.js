          <p>
            Information management is literally the foundation of a freight
            forwarding system. This is the system on which the entire process of
            freight forwarding works. From loading to unloading, from pick to
            delivery of goods, information management plays a pivotal role in
            knowing what step to take and when to take it. At CCL, we maintain a
            highly successful information management system, with online
            tracking forming a major part of this process. From the first
            activity of shipping the consignment to the last of the consignment
            reaching the desired place, the Internet acts as a tool to maintain
            a schedule of the things that have taken place and when and where
            this has been done. The system even lets you know about custom
            clearance status and the change in the means of transport as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the help of our tracking system, the customer can get to know
            the status of their consignment with the help of numbers assigned to
            the consignment. This acts as a guide for the customer to constantly
            keep in touch with their consignment and inform beforehand if the
            consignment needs to reach the desired destination earlier than
            asked for previously. This helps CCL create a different route for
            the forwarding and allows us to ensure that the consignment reaches
            the said venue on time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management of information is crucial at any step of the freight
            forwarding process and being able to access the status of their
            consignment gives customers a sense of relief. It also instills
            confidence in them because they can remain in control of the
            transportation of the consignment. The customers don’t have to wait
            idly for the consignment to arrive but can know when and how the
            goods will arrive. This transparency attracts customers’ trust
            towards the company that in turn strives harder every day to
            maintain and enhance that trust.
