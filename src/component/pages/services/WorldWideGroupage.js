          <p>
            Groupage forms a very important part of freight forwarding. In this
            process, BVS brings to together different, multiple cargos and
            consignments and creates one consignment of all those individual
            consignments. This consolidation when done for road transportation
            is termed as groupage. This sees the customer through major
            benefits. Why? When this kind of consolidation is done for
            consignments, there are two major aspects that reap the benefits:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Time:</strong>
            </li>
            <p>
              Time is saved majorly because, what might be delivered after a
              delay waiting for vehicles to be available is scheduled to arrive
              beforehand to the assigned venues.From there, the consignments are
              taken together and delivered in one go, thereby ensuring the
              delivery of the consignments before time!
            </p>
            <li>
              <strong>Money:</strong>
            </li>
            <p>
              Money also gets saved, because when you taken up something in lump
              sum, the freight costs get slashed steeply and the customer saves
              on a lot of the finances that may have originally cost more.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But how does the customer get to know whether that option is
            available in their case. Well, we tell them! You would remember that
            transparency and good advice form the basis of our objectives and
            functioning in BVS. We apply these mottos at every step we take. So
            when a consignment that can be transported via road comes to us, the
            first thing we try to see is the scope of groupage. Given the
            timeline, we advise the customer if groupage is an option and with
            their consent, go ahead and apply it.
          </p>

          <p>
            When this groupage takes an international turn involving shipments,
            it is called consolidation. The same rules apply and benefit the
            customer more than anybody else! At the end of the day, that’s what
            we want—to leave our customer happy and ready to take our help
            whenever they need it again.
