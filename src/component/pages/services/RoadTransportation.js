            In the freight forwarding business, you are nowhere unless you have
            a fleet of reliable vehicles that help you carry the consignment
            from the pick-up point to the assigned drop point. Road
            transportation is needed when a consignment is to be transferred
            from its storage point to the desired sea port or airport or when it
            reaches the desired sea port or airport and needs to be supplied to
            the anticipating third party. With multiple consignments making way
            every day, freight forwarding would become an uphill task for any
            firm.
